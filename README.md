# Weather App Assignment

## Overview

This project is a Weather App built using React. It fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and Visual Crossing Weather API from RapidAPI, providing users with comprehensive weather information. The app offers various features such as city-based weather search, user geolocation for current weather, and displays average temperature, rainfall, and humidity for the past week. Additionally, it includes a bar chart showing daily temperatures for the past 7 days.Additionally, I converted this to a PWA and learned about service workers.  PWA's enhances performance, provides offline access, and improves user experience.

## Features

- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for weather information based on city names.
- **User Geolocation:** Fetches weather data based on the user's current location.
- **Responsive Design:** The app layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on various devices.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Tremor inbuilt functionality allows for automatic switching between dark and light modes based on the user's system preferences.
- **Input Validation:** Implemented input validation with toast messages for user-friendly interactions.
- **Average Weather Data:** Displays average temperature, rainfall, and humidity for the past week.
- **Bar Chart:** Shows daily temperatures for the past 7 days in a bar chart.
- **Offline Access:** Enables users to access previously viewed weather data even when they are offline, enhancing the user experience in areas with poor internet connectivity.
